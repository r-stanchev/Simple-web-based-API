In order to run the app, you must cover the pre-requisites.
They are: Python, VirtualEnvironment, CockroachDB.

(Please note that the shell script is not tested on multiple machines, 
so I make no guarantee it will work 100% correctly)

To start the server, please run 'run.sh'.

Please note that the first time you run the file, it will download all the
dependencies.

So, to actually start the server, you will need to run the file a second time.

Each consecutive execution will run the application, as long as
you don't delete the folder called 'cockroach_folder'.

To shut down the app, use Ctrl + C.



To run the unit tests, please execute   test.py
